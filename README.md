# One_Compartment_PK_Simulation_paracetamol
 This project uses synthetic data generated from pharmacokinetic principles to simulate paracetamol plasma concentrations and evaluate the impact of renal impairment on drug exposure, highlighting the need for dose individualization in clinical practice.
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic with well-established pharmacokinetic properties. Numerous studies have characterized its absorption, metabolism, and elimination in healthy individuals.

Although paracetamol is primarily metabolized by the liver, renal impairment can affect the elimination of its metabolites and potentially influence overall drug clearance. This makes understanding pharmacokinetics in patients with varying kidney function important to avoid toxicity.

Pharmacometric simulation models are a powerful tool to explore drug behavior and optimize dosing in special populations, such as those with impaired renal function, without relying solely on real patient data.
